## on-chain-whitelist

Kakarot is cool, and so should be its whitelisting solution and faucet, a completely on-chain whitelisting solution and faucet ðŸ¥•

Instead of inviting users by sharing invitation codes, why not mint them an NFT that grants them access to Kakarot's Testnet? This is the idea behind on-chain whitelisting.

### How it works

1. The KKRT team mints an NFT that represents an invitation to the Testnet for a user.
2. These are soulbound to the recipient's address. This means that the NFT can only be used by the recipient and no one else.

### Why on-chain whitelisting?

1. **Security**: Invitation codes can be shared with anyone. NFTs are soulbound to the recipient's address.
2. **Ownership**: Invitation codes are ephemeral. NFTs are owned by the recipient.
3. **Composability**: The fact that someone has an whitelisted Kakarot NFT can be used by other purposes as well like:
    - Airdrops
    - Access to other services
    - Early access to other protocols
    - Access to certain Telegram/Discord groups
